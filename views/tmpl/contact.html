      	<p>
 			My name is Shubham Yeole, actively looking for full time opportunities in Software Development positions.
 		</p>

      	<p>
      		 I have worked on software development technologies for more than 3 years, ultimately gaining experience in many front end and back end technologies. As a full stack developer, I take pride in writing good quality of code with least complexity. My passion for development can be traced by looking at the projects I developed individually for personal comforts. Projects are available online for demo (find projects in portfolio below) and source code in open source GitHub repositories. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
	      	Recently, I was working at Prose Media LLC company to develop functionalities and fix bugs in there main platform. In initial days, I developed a robust platform for Prose Media team to help them filter 2000+ web pages. I am continuously looking for coading challanges which helps me solve real life issues.
